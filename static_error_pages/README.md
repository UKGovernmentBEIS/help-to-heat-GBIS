This directory contains our static error page when the GBIS service is unavailable.

This page is not deployed as part of our pipeline. All changes must be sent to ICS for them to update on the live site.

Version 4.9.0 of GDS is included here. Modifications to make it run statically are:

- All path references are made relative (/assets/... -> ./assets/...).
