      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Check if you may be eligible for the Great British Insulation Scheme</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>check if you may be eligible for help to insulate your property</li>
        <li>create a referral to an energy supplier to verify eligibility, assess your property and confirm what insulation could be offered</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">After your referral is created, an energy supplier may need to organise for an installer to visit your property and check which measures are suitable.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should be contacted within 10 working days by the supplier, but the overall process may take several months to complete.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You may be asked to make a financial contribution, depending on the outcome of the property assessment and insulation recommended.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Insulation measures you can get referred for </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The following measures are available through the Great British Insulation Scheme. An assessment of your property will identify which would be best for you, to help you to keep your home warm and save you money on your energy bills:</p>

        <li>room-in-roof insulation</li>
      </ul>
