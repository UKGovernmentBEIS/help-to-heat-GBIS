Hi,

Your reference number is {{referral_id}}

Your details have been submitted to {{supplier_name}}.

# What happens next?

{{supplier_name}} will contact you within 10 working days to confirm they have received your referral or to ask you for more information.

You do not need to create another referral.

{{supplier_name}} or their installation partner will review your referral and determine whether your home is suitable for insulation. They will notify you of the outcome of their review.

Due to sustained high volume of referrals, it could take several weeks for {{supplier_name}} to review your referral and tell you the outcome.

{% if is_eco4_eligible %}
{{supplier_name}} or their installation partner may also check if your home is suitable for more help with energy efficiency improvements through the [ECO4 scheme](https://www.gov.uk/energy-company-obligation).

{% endif %}
If your home is suitable it must be surveyed. Your energy supplier or their installation partner will organise this with you.
